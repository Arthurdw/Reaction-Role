> _(check out [Migrating](#migrating-from-the-python-version))_

This is a easy to use Discord bot with human friendly configuration files.

### Features

- Emoij Reaction Roles (also works with custom emoji's)
- Experience/Leveling system with leaderboard
- Token configurable from env (also loads .env) or config file
- Reaction logging
- Chat and slash command support (configurable)
- Configurable rich presence
- Configurable verbose logging

## Getting started

### Discord setup

#### Creating a bot and finding your token

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Click on `New Application` and give your bot a name.

![Create Application](./.docs/assets/2_create_application.jpg)

Then you should be redirected to the application page. Click on `Bot` in the sidebar.

Great, now we are on the page where we can manage our bot; on this page you can
change the username, avatar and banner of your bot. You can also set your bot to
be private (recommended but not required).

In order for Reaction-Role to run on your bot we need the token, initially no
token will be known, so we need to reset it. This token is very important and
should be kept secret. If you ever think your token has been compromised, or you
have lost it, you can just reset it here.

Copy the token and save it somewhere safe (we will need this for the configuration)

Our last step is to ensure the bot has the correct Discord intents enabled. We can just do this by scrolling down in the bot page and enable all intents. (or the ones that apply) Remember to save your changes.

### Configuring the bot

TODO: write this section with images etc

### Running the bot (Docker)

Now that you have your bot token, you can use the provided docker compose file
to easily get your bot up and running.

In the project directory _(where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located)_, run
the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

If you have just pulled an updated version of the bot, you might want to rebuild
the image:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### Running in the background

To run the bot in the background, you can use the `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Running from source

This bot is written in Rust, so you will need to have Rust installed on your
system. Openssl is also required for the bot to work. If you are using the
Nix package manager, you can load the `flake.nix` file.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the bot with the following

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Migrating from the Python version

**BEFORE MIGRATING, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE BOT AND BACKUP YOUR `db` FOLDER IF
PRESENT!**

The only change required is in the config.
Make the `.py` and `.cfg` files to the expected YAML format.
All data will keep working.

### Why moving to Rust?

Rust provides a more stable development environment and is just my preferred
language. As an added bonus, it's faster and more efficient than Python.

### Why moving to YAML?

The YAML format is language independent and is easier to read and write.
This change allows for more flexibility in the configuration and for a
potentional future where the bot is rewritten in another language.

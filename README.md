# Discord Reaction Role Bot
###### Using UtilsX (w discord.py)

## Requirements
To be able to run this bot you have [Python](https://www.python.org). (Min: [3.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/), Max: [3.8.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/))  
When Python has been installed open your CLI and navigate to the directory.
And when you are in the correct directory execute the following command to install the dependencies:
```
(python3 -m | py -3 -m) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting
If you are getting a `ImportError` please re-run the install command.
If this doesn't fix the problem please run the following command:
```
(python3 -m | py -3 -m) pip install -U discord.py
```

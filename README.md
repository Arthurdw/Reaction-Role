## About

> ðŸ”¥ The bot has been fully rewritten in Rust! ðŸ”¥
> _(check out [Migrating](#migrating-from-the-python-version))_

This is a easy to use Discord bot with human friendly configuration files.

### Features

-

## Migrating from the Python version

**BEFORE MIGRATING, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE BOT AND BACKUP YOUR `db` FOLDER IF
PRESENT!**

The only change required is in the config.
Make the `.py` and `.cfg` files to the expected YAML format.
All data will keep working.

### Why moving to Rust?

Rust provides a more stable development environment and is just my preferred
language. As an added bonus, it's faster and more efficient than Python.

### Why moving to YAML?

The YAML format is language independent and is easier to read and write.
This change allows for more flexibility in the configuration and for a
potentional future where the bot is rewritten in another language.
